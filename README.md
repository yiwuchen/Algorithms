## Algorithm Analysis

### Big O Notation
Complexity increases from left to right. 
| O(1) | O(logn) | O(n) | O(nlogn) | O(n^2) | O(2^n) | O(n!) | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constant | Logarithmic | Linear | Linearithmic | Quatratic | Exponential | Factorial |

Space Analysis
Bit: 0 or 1
Byte: 8 bits
64-bit machine usually use 8 byte pointers
